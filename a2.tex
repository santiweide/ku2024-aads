\section{Linear Programming - B}
\textbf{Question:}
Write an LP in standard form in the plane so that: (1) the feasible region is a convex polygon with 5 edges, (2) the maximum of the LP is 1 and (3) the maximum is achieved on a full edge of the feasible region (and not just a single vertex)

\section{Linear Programming - C}
\textbf{Question}
This exercise demonstrates that LP can represent non-linearities (like absolute values). Let f be a function from the set {1,2} to the real numbers. 

Write an LP whose value is $|f(1)|+|f(2)|$, and write the dual to this LP. In your solutions, all the entries in the matrix A and in the vectors b,c must be affine functions in $f(1)$ and $f(2)$; that is, each entry must be of the form $d f(1) + e f(2) + g$ where $d$,$e$,$g$ are real numbers. For example, in dimension n = 3, the vector b can be $(3 f(1), 0, -2f(2)+1)$ but not $(|f(1)|,0,0)$.

\section{Randomized Algorithm-1}
\textbf{Question}
For any given key x in S, let d(x) be the depth of x in the search tree generated by RandQS. Give a lower and an upper bound, as a function of the number of keys n, on the expected value of d(x) such that these bounds are within a constant factor from each other. That is, find a function f(n) and prove that E[d(x)]=Theta(f(n)).
